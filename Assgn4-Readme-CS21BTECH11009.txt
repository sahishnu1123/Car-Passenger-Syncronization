On successful compilation, run the executable file with an additional argument of input file's name. Pass the inout file's name as argument.

In the input file, data is to be given in the following order:

Number of Passengers, Number of Cars, Average time in milliseconds for wander time distribution, Average time for travel time in milliseconds distribution, Number of rounds.

On successful execution, the programs gives an output file named output.txt with its contents as mentioned in the problem statement.

Along with the output file, the executable also prints 'the total time taken by a particular passenger', 'average time taken by a passenger to finish all his rides' and also 'the average time taken by a car to finish riding all the requested passengers' in the terminal.

The terminal outputs are given in milliseconds.
